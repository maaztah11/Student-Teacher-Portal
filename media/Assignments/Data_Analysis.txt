1. Automated Campaign Performance Dashboards
What You Can Do Today:
PowerBI:

Connect to data sources (Excel, CSV, Google Sheets, SQL databases) and build interactive dashboards.

Track KPIs like CTR, conversions, ROI, and CPA with drag-and-drop visuals.

Example: Create a dashboard comparing Facebook Ads vs. Google Ads performance by campaign, audience, or geography.

Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn):

Generate static visualizations (e.g., weekly trend charts) and embed them in reports.

Use libraries like Plotly or Dash for interactive web-based dashboards (if you‚Äôre open to learning a new library).

Gaps to Fill:
Data Pipeline Automation:

Learn to schedule data refreshes (e.g., PowerBI‚Äôs built-in refresh tool or Python scripts with Task Scheduler/cron jobs).

Use APIs (e.g., Facebook Marketing API, Google Ads API) to pull live campaign data automatically.

Start with Python‚Äôs requests library or pre-built tools like pandas-gbq for Google BigQuery.

Action Step:

Practice by building a sample dashboard with a free dataset (e.g., Google Merchandise Store dataset) in PowerBI.

2. Custom Reports with Pandas
What You Can Do Today:
Automate Repetitive Tasks:

Write Python scripts to clean, aggregate, and summarize campaign data (e.g., weekly email performance).

Export polished reports as Excel/PDF files using pandas + openpyxl or matplotlib for charts.

Example Workflow:

Pull raw CSV/Excel data from a marketing platform (e.g., Facebook Ads).

Clean data (remove duplicates, fix date formats) with pandas.

Calculate metrics like CTR, CPC, and ROAS.

Generate a formatted Excel file with tables/charts and email it to stakeholders.

Gaps to Fill:
Integration with Email/Slack:

Learn to send automated emails with reports using Python‚Äôs smtplib or tools like Microsoft Power Automate.

Use libraries like schedule to run scripts daily/weekly.

Action Step:

Automate a mock "weekly social media report" using a Kaggle dataset (e.g., Social Media Ads Dataset).

How to Start Offering These Services
Build a Portfolio:

Create 2-3 sample dashboards/reports (even with fake data) to showcase your process.
